# Task 2: Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling

## Objective
The goal of this task is to understand and implement proper data cleaning techniques by identifying and handling missing values in a real-world dataset using Python.

## Dataset Used
House Prices Dataset (Ames Housing Dataset)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure.
2. Identified missing values using Pandas functions.
3. Visualized missing value distribution using bar charts.
4. Removed columns with extremely high missing values.
5. Applied median imputation for numerical features.
6. Applied mode imputation for categorical features.
7. Validated the dataset to ensure no missing values remain.
8. Saved the cleaned dataset for future modeling tasks.

## Outcome
The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for machine learning or statistical analysis.

## Learning
This task strengthened my understanding of data quality, missing value strategies, and preprocessing best practices required before building ML models.
